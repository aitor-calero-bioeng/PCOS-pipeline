An end-to-end Biomedical Machine Learning project that integrates clinical data preprocessing, model training, and a web-based clinical decision support tool for **Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)** risk assessment.

## Project Overview

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine and reproductive disorders in women. Early identification of clinical risk factors is essential for preventing long-term metabolic and fertility complications.

Developed as part of my **B.Sc. in Bioengineering** portfolio, this project bridges computational data analysis with clinical biomarkers. It processes merged patient datasets, cleans conflictive hormonal parameters, trains a **Random Forest Classifier**, and provides a real-time risk assessment interface powered by **Streamlit**.

## Bioengineering & ML Highlights

* **Biomarker Selection:** Selected key clinical indicators validated in medical literature (Age, BMI, Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH), Follicle Count in both ovaries, Menstrual Cycle Regularity, Weight Gain, and Hirsutism).
* **Data Cleaning & Imputation:** Handled missing values via median imputation and performed dynamic column cleaning to resolve string coercion issues in hormonal variables (`AMH` and `II beta-HCG`).
* **Stratified Classification:** Utilized an 80/20 train-test split with stratification to maintain diagnosis class distribution and prevent model bias.
* **Model Export & Inference:** Serialized the trained model using `joblib` for low-latency predictions in the web frontend.
